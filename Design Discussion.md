### Pros:
- Clear representation of core functionalities such as managing grocery lists and database interaction.
- Utilizes a class-based approach with methods for adding, deleting, and modifying items in a list.
- Ensures automatic and immediate saving of lists after modifications, enhancing data persistence.
- Modular design with separate classes for items, item types, and grocery lists, promoting code organization and reusability.

### Cons:
- Lack of detailed modeling for certain functionalities, such as hierarchical item selection and check-off marks.
- Assumptions about implementation details, such as database interactions, may need further clarification.

### Pros:
- Clear representation of classes and methods for grocery list management, database operations.
- Comprehensive database schema design with support for hierarchical item selection and search functionality.
- Emphasis on automatic saving of lists, persistent storage of check-off marks.

### Cons:
- Lack of detailed specifications for certain implementation aspects, such as database interactions.
- Assumptions about system behavior may need further validation through testing.

## Team Discussion

- The team discussed the strengths and weaknesses of each design, focusing on refining implementation details and clarifying assumptions.
- After thorough consideration, Design 4 was chosen as the team design due to its structured approach and comprehensive coverage of functionalities.
- Suggestions were made to validate assumptions, gather user feedback, and refine the chosen design further to ensure user satisfaction and data integrity.

## Summary

- The discussions highlighted the strengths and limitations of each design, providing valuable insights for refining the Team Design.
- Through the process of discussing the designs, several valuable lessons were learned, encompassing various aspects of design, teamwork, and other relevant considerations.
- Clear and detailed design documentation is crucial for ensuring that all team members have a shared understanding of the project's requirements and goals.
- Models should encompass all essential functionalities with clarity and specificity to guide implementation effectively.
- Effective teamwork involves open communication and constructive feedback. Encouraging discussions allows team members to identify strengths and weaknesses in each design.
- Through discussion, compare the advantages of different designs and choose a design that we all agree on. This can also expand our ideas.
- We all agree to pick Susmeta's designs as team designs. 
- During the discussions, we learned the balance between thoroughness and efficiency. While comprehensive designs are valuable, they should not sacrifice clarity or efficiency.
- By embracing these lessons, teams can foster effective collaboration and produce well-defined designs.
